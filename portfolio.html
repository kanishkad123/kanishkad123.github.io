				  <h2>2017</h2>
				  <p>With an inclination towards ‘Real World Problem Solving’ and having fared exceptionally well in my secondary education, 
				  I went on to equip myself with a 3 year diploma in Electronics & Telecommunication engineering. My curriculum here enhanced my knowledge in 
				  subjects like C Programming, Visual Basic, Computer Fundamentals, Principles of Computer Architecture and Maintenance with insights 
				  to professional practices. Completing my diploma with Distinction, I immediately secured admission for a Bachelor’s program in the 
				  same faculty at the prestigious Sinhgad College of Engineering (Pune University).</p>

				  <h2>2016</h2>
				  <p>Experiencing real life implementation of topics learned in my courses such as Object Oriented Programming, Computer Networks, 
				  Data Structures and Algorithms & Embedded Systems and RTOS, during the final year of my Bachelor’s, when I got a chance to work on a 
				  live project at Cummins India, piqued my interest in computer science. My project focused on electronic control unit part inside 
				  vehicle engines. Interrupt programming a low power consumption Renesas controller to push multiple sensors’ data to SQL databases 
				  by calling a web API was an integral part of the project. Successfully completing the given tasks well before the deadlines gave us an 
				  opportunity to program display backlight using Pulse-Width-Modulation to reduce power consumption further below 50% prompting us to name 
				  our project as Smart Graphic Display.</p>

						<h2>2019</h2>
						<p>My fascination towards software development was consolidated when I gained exposure to neural networks during my final semester 
						course of Soft Computing. I was intrigued by the problem solving challenges it had to offer and the science that goes into building the 
						crux of any software i.e. Visualizing, Capturing and Manipulating data. Despite having a narrow exposure to this field in my under 
						graduation, this mere curiosity soon became a passion for me</p>

						<p>The day after my graduation, I joined as a UI developer intern at Mark Enterprises, a bio-medical engineering firm, taking my first 
						step towards Visualization of data. I quickly became familiar with HTML, CSS and Javascript to design multiple web pages for effective 
						representation of data. Consuming latest open-source libraries like D3JS for plotting sales and marketing data from excel, updated me 
						with current trends. The hard work paid off when, based on my performance, I was asked to improve the user experience of the business 
						website after which a 67% rise in website visitors was achieved. This allowed me better insights into industry standards of handling 
						sensitive data.</p>

						<p>Progressing towards server side programming to accomplish my next goal of Capturing and Manipulating data, I worked as a 
						software developer at Cybernetics Software Pvt. Ltd, an access control software development company. I worked on Microsoft’s .Net, 
						a software application development framework using C# and VB. Gaining mastery over Winforms(desktop based) and Webforms(Web based), 
						I learned the shortcomings of legacy frameworks for software development. On 5th June 2017, I grabbed the opportunity to be a 
						full stack developer at Intellection Software & Technologies Pvt. Ltd. as I worked on ASP.Net Web API as backend with Angular 5 as 
						frontend technologies to build multi-tenant, multi-tiered architecture applications, used to manage the inspection process of 
						pressure vessel manufacturing, where the tenant specific data was stored in MongoDB and the user management related data was stored 
						in Microsoft SQL server.</p>

						<h2></h2>
						<p>I was known to release deliverables on time because I understood the importance of source code control tools like Git & project 
						management tools like JIRA, following my organization into SCRUM development. Impressed by my potential, I was selected to spearhead 
						proof of concept implementation for audio fingerprinting and recognition algorithm to be used for Target-Rating-Point in TV. 
						I succeeded by applying Fast-Fourier-Transform with NumPy and SciPy (Python), to samples of audio and it was at this point I 
						discovered the true dynamism of combining the strong foundation laid by my undergraduate studies with computer science. 
						With this accomplishment, after perusing some IEEE papers, I am now working on realizing video fingerprinting detection using 
						skew detection algorithm via text row accumulation, the underlying principle of Google’s Tesseract OCR engine.
